	<p id="para1">Digital cameras started to see the light in the late 1970's. Digital cameras use a form of storage that normally can be used on the computer. With digital photos you dont have to process hte photo in a darkroom, instead you can use photosop. Photoshop is a application used to edit and manipulate photos to what ever you want. There are many other editing programs like Snapseed and lightroom you can use. </p>
