	<p id="para1">There are many forms of cameras. From the most expensive DSLR to the cheapest smartphone, there is a camera for everyone. Certain cameras have more fucntion over others. For example DSLR cameras have a live viewfinder while a mirrorless camera a digital one. Mirrorless cameras and smartphones have good stabilization. But whatever camera you prefer to use you can create anything you want. Its not the camera that makes the photo, its the person behind the lens.</p>
